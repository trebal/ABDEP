We have a watch shop. We also have different brands (Glorious Invictas
and another lesser brand not worth to mention), which are classified
by classes. Note that operations on the stock price modifies not
only the price, but also specific attributes. So a generic method
is not valid.

In order to change the price of the stock we will use
the Visitor pattern.
